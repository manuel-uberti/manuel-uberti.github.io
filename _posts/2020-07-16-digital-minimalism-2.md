It’s been more than a year since I decided to try my best at [Digital Minimalism](https://www.manueluberti.eu/real-life/2019/04/10/digital-minimalism/)
and recently I’ve found myself discussing my efforts with non-believers.
Reviewing the resolutions described in the afore-linked article, I noticed a
considerable level of progress on two of them in particular:

- I don’t use RSS feeds any more
- I check Letterboxd sparingly

The first one may come as a surprise considering how highly I think of [Elfeed](https://www.manueluberti.eu/emacs/2017/08/01/elfeed/).
The problem is not the tool one uses to collect updates, of course. The problem
is how pervasive they had become. I felt irresistibly attracted to the news
provided by my collection of RSS entries, pulled into my Elfeed buffer over and
over again. But was it worth it? How many times I was just marking an entry as
read before reading it fully? This can be very subjective, sure, and the beauty
of an update speaks more about my taste in RSS feeds than the actual content.
Not to mention the simple fact that one could just learn to set their priorities
and schedule feed-checking at precise times.

Nonetheless, this is why I dropped Elfeed entirely and subscribed to a handful
of weekly and biweekly newsletters. I still want to be informed and I still like
to read about Emacs, philosophy, literature, cinema, and music, but the
information should not overwhelm me and be a distraction.

As for Letterboxd, it has sadly become another digital addiction which in return
has been giving me little. Partly because one of my favourite film critics has
vanished from the website and partly because most of the recent films I watched
barely moved me, I’ve been neglecting my cinephilia in favour of books. As a
result, constantly browsing Letterboxd has developed into seldom visiting the
website to register my viewings. Unfortunately this also means my other blog
misses me, but the love for cinema is still strong, so it’s only a matter of
time.

For someone working in IT it’s kind of ironic to write about detachment from
technology, I know. Rest assured, I am not working my way to the life of a
farmer. At the same time, though, I’d be lying if I say that having more time
for other things isn’t what I was really looking for after all.
