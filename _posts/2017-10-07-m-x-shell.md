summary:    Coming to grips with `shell-mode`.

As much as most of my daily workflow revolves around Emacs, I always have GNOME
terminal ready to fly with [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com) and
[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux). I keep EShell next to me for quick tasks,
but I have never relied on `shell-mode` or `ansi-term` for other CLI-intensive
work.

I don’t know what happened to the lovely “Emacs Chat” series from Sacha Chua,
but more than three years ago [she interviewed Mickey
Petersen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA4dqmDFt5Y). Mickey talked with great
enthusiasm about `shell-mode` and at the time I admittedly made a mental note
about giving it a try. Regretfully, I have only recently come back to that note.

My first <kbd>M-x shell</kbd> didn’t look that great. I haven’t debugged the
compatibility issues with Fish, probably something related to my heavily
customised `config.fish`. Anyway, falling back to Bash is enough.

``` emacs-lisp
(validate-setq explicit-shell-file-name "/bin/bash")
```

Note that I am using `validate-setq` as explained
[here](http://manuel-uberti.github.io/emacs/2016/09/17/validate/).

Another thing I have noticed is the lack of colours for the output of
`ls`. Fortunately, [Emacs StackExchange has an
answer](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/17484/5514) for that, so I have added
this line to my `.bash_aliases` file:

``` shell
alias ls="TERM=ansi ls --color=always"
```

The input echoing is easily turned off following the [instructions on the
manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/efaq-w32/Shell-echo.html). Also,
the history is much cleaner and easier to navigate with `counsel-shell-history`.

``` emacs-lisp
(unbind-key "C-c C-l" shell-mode-map)
(bind-key "C-c C-l" #'counsel-shell-history shell-mode-map)
```

Note that `unbind-key` and `bind-key` are macros from `bind-key.el`, which is
part of the fantastic [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package).

Last but not least, I like to have my shell buffer filling the whole window in
the current frame. Thus,
[display-buffer-alist](http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Var/display-buffer-alist.html)
to the rescue.

``` emacs-lisp
(validate-setq
 display-buffer-alist
 `(
   ;; … other stuff …
   (,(rx bos "*shell")
    (display-buffer-same-window)
    (reusable-frames . nil))
   ;; … other stuff …
  ))
```
