summary:    Why am I writing in English, now!?

This is my new personal website.

I used to have a personal website in Italian where I wrote regularly about my
experiments with GNU/Linux and GNU Emacs.

I decided to stop writing in Italian for different reasons:

- my English is good enough to give it a try
- I am already writing in English for my [film
  blog](https://www.filmsinwords.eu/), so it makes sense to stick with English
- I am going to have way more chances to discuss my thoughts with the world

Beside the language, there is another difference between the two blogs. Instead
of an article every Monday like I did on my previous website, I will write
whenever I feel like writing.

It’s a _personal_ blog, isn’t it?
