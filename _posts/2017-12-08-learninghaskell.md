Since my first baby steps in the world of Functional Programming, Haskell has
been there. Like the enchanting music of a Siren, it has been luring me with
promises of a new set of skills and a better understanding of the *lambda
calculus*.

I refused to oblige at first. A bit of Scheme and [my eventual move to
Clojure](https://manuel-uberti.github.io/programming/2017/03/12/anewjob/)
occupied my mind and my daily activities. Truth be told, the odious warfare
between dynamic types troopers and static types zealots didn’t help steering my
enthusiasm towards Haskell.

Still, my curiosity is stoic and hard to kill and the Haskell Siren was becoming
too tempting to resist any further. [The Pragmatic
Programmer](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer) in me knew
it was the right thing to do. My knowledge portfolio is always reaching out for
something new.

My journey began with the much praised [Programming in
Haskell](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html). [I kept
track](https://github.com/manuel-uberti/programming-in-haskell) of the exercises
only to soon discover this wasn’t the right book for me. A bit too terse and
schematic, I needed something that could ease me in in a different way. I needed
more focus on the basics, the roots of the language.

As I usually do, I sought help online. I don’t know many Haskell developers, but
I know there are crazy guys in the Emacs community. [Steve
Purcell](https://github.com/purcell) was kind and patient enough to introduce me
to [Haskell Programming From First Principles](http://haskellbook.com/).

This is a huge book (nearly 1300 pages), but it just took the authors’ prefaces
to hook me. Julie Moronuki words in particular resonated heavily with me. Unlike
Julie I have experience in programming, but I felt exactly like her when it
comes to approaching Haskell teaching materials.

So here I am, armed with [Stack](https://haskellstack.org) and
[Intero](https://commercialhaskell.github.io/intero/) and ready to abandon
myself to the depths and wonders of static typing and pure functional
programming. I will track my progress and maybe report back here. I already have
a project in mind, but my Haskell needs to get really good before starting any
serious work.

May the lambda be with me.
