summary:    Accounting with Clojure and ClojureScript.

The usefulness of in-house accounting has become evident only in recent
years. On different occasions, my wife and I discussed a solution for keeping
track of expenses and available budget for short- and long-term goals. Simply
put: the bank statement was not enough any more.

In the past we relied on [ledger](https://www.ledger-cli.org/), knowing too well
the power of plain text. For a while we succeeded in our money management,
because ledger is really that good. However, soon we started thinking about
savings and goals, about a custom user interface to have a better understanding
of our financial situation.

Naturally, I decided to use some of the experience I gained at work to develop
our own application. I wanted a simple [single-page
application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) that would
enable us to:

- track *expenses*
- query expenses to get *reports*
- track short- and long-term *goals*

boodle (a synonym of money, in case you are wondering) has the following
architecture:

- client: [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame)
- server: [ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) on top of [HTTP
  kit](http://www.http-kit.org/)
- database: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

I have set up [bidi](https://github.com/juxt/bidi) for client-side routing,
[compojure](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure) for server-side routing
and [compojure-api](https://github.com/metosin/compojure-api) to connect client
and server via pleasant APIs.

Thanks to [mount](https://github.com/tolitius/mount) I have three main
components that I can start and stop to make development and debugging easier:
application configuration, database and HTTP server.

I decided to give [dire](https://github.com/MichaelDrogalis/dire) a try,
appreciating the separation between logic and error handling. I also took the
chance to couple
[clojure.test](https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.test-api.html) with
[test.check](https://github.com/clojure/test.check), for some basic
property-based testing, and [lein-eftest](https://github.com/weavejester/eftest)
to have fast and pretty test results.

The setup is completed by the continuous integration offered by [Travis
CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [Deps Versions](https://versions.deps.co/) to
identify outdated dependencies. Everything is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/manuel-uberti/boodle), if you want to dig deeper
into the details.

boodle is currently deployed on my home server, and in the last months it has
proved to be a reliable tool. It also deepened my love for Clojure and
ClojureScript. Long forgotten are the days where separation of concerns, both
client- and server-side, seemed impossible and destined to fail.
