There was a time when I just didn’t trust Emacs. This lack of confidence was the
result of mixing good and evil: listening to other reliable Emacsers’ opinions
while being too lazy to see for myself what Emacs could do. The outcome of this
endeavour was a frenetic copying-and-pasting of code snippets in my `init.el`,
blindly dragging in more and more external packages.

Don’t get me wrong, external packages made Emacs what it is today for me.
I can’t even imagine using it without the likes of [Magit](https://magit.vc/) or [CIDER](https://cider.mx/). However,
ignoring what is already there and reaching for MELPA every time I have an itch
to scratch has made me overlook built-in niceties like [project.el](https://www.manueluberti.eu/emacs/2020/09/18/project/).

[Flymake](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/flymake/index.html#Top) did fell prey of this line of reasoning. [Flycheck](https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/) has always seemed like
the way go, so much so that I have barely registered João Távora’s and other
Emacs developers’ efforts to improve Flymake. Since my recent experiments with
`project.el` have turned my eyes inwards again, I wanted to see if I can live
without Flycheck.

There are three places where I need on-the-fly syntax checking:

- Emacs Lisp package files with [package-lint](https://github.com/purcell/package-lint)
- Clojure files with [clj-kondo](https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo)
- Markdown files with [proselint](http://proselint.com/)

Kind people took care of Emacs Lisp and Clojure for me: `package-lint-flymake`
comes with `package-lint` and [flymake-kondor](https://github.com/turbo-cafe/flymake-kondor) is a valid alternative to
[flycheck-clj-kondo](https://github.com/borkdude/flycheck-clj-kondo). But I wasn’t able to find an existing integration with
`proselint`, so I decided to provide one.

My first tries with [flymake-easy](https://github.com/purcell/flymake-easy) didn’t go very well. I asked for help on [Emacs
StackExchange](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/60769/configure-flymake-for-proselint), before realizing I could use [flymake-quickdef](https://github.com/karlotness/flymake-quickdef) like `flymake-kondor`
does and [answer to myself](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/60771/5514). The next step was making the solution available to
everyone in the form of a package, and so I published the little
[flymake-proselint](https://github.com/manuel-uberti/flymake-proselint).

Flymake may not have the extensive support for checkers that its bigger brother
has, and it doesn’t seem to have the same huge community behind, but it’s still
a great library to play with. There is a comparison between the two projects on
the [Flycheck website](https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/user/flycheck-versus-flymake.html), so have a look there before making your choice. Note that
the comparison doesn’t mention `flymake-quickdef`, which I find easier to use for
extending Flymake.

As for me, my requirements for on-the-fly syntax checking are met by Flymake. At
the end of the day it’s good to know that after all these years together Emacs
can still surprise me.
