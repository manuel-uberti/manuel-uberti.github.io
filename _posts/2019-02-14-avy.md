Last time I shared my preferred choice for [buffer
switching](https://manuel-uberti.github.io/emacs/2019/02/05/nswbuff/), so
let’s keep jumping around. The [House of
Pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhzpxjuwZy0) reference is a bit tacky,
I know, but 90s nostalgia is still flying pretty high from what I’ve heard.

Quickly moving in a buffer is something every Emacs knight do multiple times a
day. I distinguish in-buffer jumps in two categories:

- jumps that encompass all the buffer content
- jumps limited to what is currently visible

The first movements are covered by Oleh
Krehel’s [Swiper](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper), but I am more interested
in the second kind of jumps this time. There are plenty of solutions both
bundled in Emacs (e.g., [pop/mark
commands](http://endlessparentheses.com/faster-pop-to-mark-command.html)) and in
the wild. My favourite is [avy](https://github.com/abo-abo/avy), again from Oleh
Krehel.

``` emacs-lisp
(use-package avy-jump                   ; Jump to characters in buffers
  :ensure avy
  :bind (("C-j" . avy-goto-char-in-line)
         ("M-j" . avy-goto-char)))
```

As it always happens with Oleh’s packages, `avy` is well-documented, easy to
extend, and full of useful commands. I only added bindings for the ones I use
the most, and I really use these two all the time.

`avy-goto-char` allows me to move anywhere following the character I am after.
It’s quicker than typing the whole candidate in Swiper, and obviously better
than manually moving point[^note] with <kbd>C-p</kbd>/<kbd>C-n</kbd> or,
worse, the arrow keys.

`avy-goto-char-in-line` behaves in much the same way, but it is limited to the
current line. If you remember `iy-go-to-char` mentioned years ago on [Emacs
Rocks](http://emacsrocks.com/e04.html), this is Oleh’s own variant.

Both commands push point to the
[mark-ring](http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Var/mark-ring), so the default
Emacs key binding <kbd>C-u C-SPC</kbd> takes you back to your original position.

However, there is an even quicker alternative when I want to jump between
occurrences of the symbol where point currently is, which turns out to be pretty
handy when coding.

``` emacs-lisp
(use-package symbol-overlay             ; Highlight symbols
  :ensure t
  :bind (:map symbol-overlay-mode-map
              ("M-h" . symbol-overlay-put)
              ("M-n" . symbol-overlay-jump-next)
              ("M-p" . symbol-overlay-jump-prev))
  :hook ((conf-mode . symbol-overlay-mode)
         (html-mode . symbol-overlay-mode)
         (prog-mode . symbol-overlay-mode)
         (yaml-mode . symbol-overlay-mode)))
```

[symbol-overlay](https://github.com/wolray/symbol-overlay) not only highlights
all the occurrences of the current symbol, but it lets you move quickly among
them with `symbol-overlay-jump-prev` and `symbol-overlay-jump-next` without
asking for a character to look for.

Moreover, `symbol-overlay` works on all the buffer content, so in this
particular case is quicker than Swiper too.
