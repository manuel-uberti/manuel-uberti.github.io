Few days ago, Zach Tellman published a complete draft of his upcoming book
[Elements of Clojure](http://elementsofclojure.com).

This is a work I have been following closely for a while. I purchased an early
draft and have been there at every update from the author, ready to read it all
over again. Furthermore, Zach’s talks at various conferences[^one] reinforced my
belief that he is on a path I am eager to follow.

This kind of devotion is not easy to explain, but I will do my best. Since my
first Java 1.2 guide through my experiences with C, SQL, Scheme, Scala, Clojure
and now Haskell, IT books have been a constant in my life.

Most of them, unfortunately, became outdated soon, and now serve only as dust
support. Some of them, however, stood the test of time and proved to be a
reliable source of invaluable knowledge. [Structure and Intepretation of
Computer Programs](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/index.xhtml), for
instance, is still next to me, still teaching me how to be a better programmer.

Why is that? Because a book like *SICP* is not teaching a programming language
in particular. It’s not trying to be the ultimate reference on Scheme inner
details, nor it wants to be a guide to improve your Scheme skills. *SICP* is
about the *how*, not the *what*. And that is exactly where *Elements of Clojure*
fits.

Much like *SICP*, *Elements of Clojure* uses a specific language to convey its
points. It’s the common ground, the starting point from where Zach anchors his
reasoning and expands his thoughts about software development. What at first
looks like a collection of best practices gradually morphs into a deep dive in
the realms of indirection, abstraction and composition. Therefore, this is a
book about the grain of my everyday programming.

I admire the writing style of *Elements of Clojure*. Sharp, terse, it challenges
the reader at every turn of the page. You are invited to look for what is
missing or left between the lines somewhere else. Zach helps you by leaving a
decent amount of footnotes with literary references for further inquiries, and
I am confident the final version of the book will have a precise
bibliography[^two].

These literary references are particularly interesting. They diverge from the IT
way and end up in literature, philosophy, architecture, social politics and
economics. From what I have read so far, this is a totally mind-stretching,
enriching journey, all the more because these are works outside my comfort
zone.

At every step of the writing process, Zach has questioned his own experiences
and studies with his open attitude towards feedback and discussion[^three]. It
all reflects in his prose, and this is a testament to the honest quality of his
writing.

*Elements of Clojure* is always a few clicks away from me, and it’s not even
complete yet. I already know it will stay by my side for a long time.

[^one]: Start with [On Abstraction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9pxbnFC4aQ), but I hope to see
    more recent videos before long.

[^two]: There is already a shelf with recommendations on the author’s [Goodreads
    profile](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/54250608?shelf=elements-of-clojure).

[^three]: A book club has recently popped up on
    [ClojureVerse](https://clojureverse.org/t/elements-of-clojure-book-club/1769). A specific [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/elements-of-clojure) to discuss
the book has also been around for a while, courtesy of the author
himself. Moreover, he set up workshops around his work at conferences, but I haven’t been able to attend one yet.
