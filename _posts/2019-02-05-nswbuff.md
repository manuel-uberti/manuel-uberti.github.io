One of the most valuable packages I rely on everyday is
[counsel-projectile](https://github.com/ericdanan/counsel-projectile). Combining
the power of [counsel](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) and
[Projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile), this great work from Eric
Danan has been governing my project management in Emacs for quite a while.

One nifty feature of `counsel-projectile` is
`counsel-projectile-switch-to-buffer`, bound to <kbd>C-c p b</kbd>, which lets
you pick the buffer to switch to from the current project’s open buffers.

However, old habits never die. Years and years of <kbd>Ctrl+TAB</kbd> and
<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+TAB</kbd> in my web browser window are hard to forget. And so
enters Joost Kremers’ [nswbuff](https://github.com/joostkremers/nswbuff).

``` emacs-lisp
(use-package nswbuff                    ; Quick switching between buffers
  :ensure t
  :bind* (("<C-tab>"           . nswbuff-switch-to-next-buffer)
          ("<C-S-iso-lefttab>" . nswbuff-switch-to-previous-buffer))
  :config (setq nswbuff-buffer-list-function #'nswbuff-projectile-buffer-list
                nswbuff-display-intermediate-buffers t
                nswbuff-exclude-buffer-regexps '("^ .*" "^\\*.*\\*")))
```

~~I am loading it from a specific path, because at the time of this writing [the
package is not on MELPA](https://github.com/melpa/melpa/pull/6005).~~

The key setting here is the value of `nswbuff-buffer-list-function`. Using
`nswbuff-projectile-buffer-list` activates `nswbuff` integration with
`Projectile`, and so I can quickly move between my project buffers hitting the
good ol’ <kbd>Ctrl+TAB</kbd>.
