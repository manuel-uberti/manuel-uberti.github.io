Since I moved to [bullet-journaling](https://www.manueluberti.eu/real-life/2019/08/25/bujo/), most of the time I have been writing on
paper. Even though I’ve not restricted my Emacs time to Clojure programming,
paper and fountain pen have changed the way I approach my favourite text editor
for prose.

As I was writing articles for my blogs, I’ve discovered that I wanted my
text-editing environment as close as possible to the beautiful, distraction-free
feeling of a blank page. There are plenty of themes and modes out there to suit
this particular need, but the combination of settings and packages I am about to
describe has proven to be the most satisfying so far.

## Theme

A light theme is the obvious choice to mirror the paper look. Since I have been
using [modus-operandi](https://www.manueluberti.eu/emacs/2020/03/16/modus-themes/) for a while now, there is no reason to look for something
else. Everything in `markdown-mode` is supported, and with a `variable-pitch` font
([FiraGO](https://bboxtype.com/typefaces/FiraGO/#!layout=specimen) in my case) the buffer stops resembling code for once.

## Editing modes

I write all my articles in Markdown, but to achieve the desired distraction-free
effect I rely on Protesilaos Stavrou’s tips, slightly adjusted to my
preferences: ["Focused editing tools" for Emacs](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2020-07-16-emacs-focused-editing/) and [Emacs: configuring mixed
fonts in Org mode](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2020-07-17-emacs-mixed-fonts-org/). I am using a variant of [Olivetti](https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti/issues/39#issuecomment-660606677) like him, the only
difference being the use of `text-scale-increase` to increase the text size and
`text-scale-decrease` to restore it back to normal when leaving the mode.

On top of that I use [freeze-it](https://github.com/rnkn/freeze-it), which is like having someone slapping my hands
away from the text before the current paragraph. Harsh, yes, but for the
obsessive-compulsive writer an effective way to keep the mind focused on one
thing at the time. I can always review the previous paragraphs later, and with
the big picture in front of me editing often becomes deleting.

## Mode-line

Once again, I find myself tweaking the mode-line. Setting
`modus-operandi-theme-3d-modeline` has been enough thus far, but something less
prominent can be closer to the no-frills of my BuJo. Luckily [William Rankin](https://github.com/rnkn/freeze-it), the
author of Olivetti and `freeze-it`, [shared his magic tricks](https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti/issues/39#issuecomment-660606677) and I followed his
lead. I merely threw in coloured indicators for modified, read-only, and remote
buffers. Sorry, I can’t resist a little bit of fanciness.

## Final notes

There is more than this to my writing environment. For instance, I wrote about
[spell-checking](http://127.0.0.1:4000/emacs/2020/03/07/ispell-with-helm/) before and I use Artur Malabarba’s suggestions on [paragraph
movements](http://endlessparentheses.com/meta-binds-part-2-a-peeve-with-paragraphs.html). Not to mention the default Emacs facilities for marking, killing,
yanking, and moving around the buffer. Nonetheless, this should be enough to
write prose in a quieter and more fruitful way.
