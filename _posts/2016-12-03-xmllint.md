summary:    Clean up and format XML buffers with `xmllint`.

Since I deal with many SOAP web services for work, I also have to deal with lots
of XML files. In the application server log they usually appear on one line,
which makes the reading unnecessarily painful. Fortunately, Emacs coupled with
the handy `xmllint` comes to the rescue.

First, I installed `xmllint` with: `sudo apt-get install libxml2-utils`

Now I could format my XML buffers with: <kbd>C-x h C-u M-|</kbd> `xmllint
-format -` <kbd>RET</kbd>

However, this is Emacs, so there is always a more productive way to solve
problems. Why should I have to input the options for `xmllint` or remember the
necessary key bindings all the times?

``` emacs-lisp
(defun mu-xml-format ()
  "Format an XML buffer with `xmllint'."
  (interactive)
  (shell-command-on-region (point-min) (point-max)
                           "xmllint -format -"
                           (current-buffer) t
                           "*Xmllint Error Buffer*" t))
```

Since I only need this utility in XML buffers, I bound it for `nxml-mode-map`.

``` emacs-lisp
(use-package nxml-mode                  ; XML editing
  :mode "\\.xml\\'"
  :bind (:map nxml-mode-map
              ("C-c m f" . mu-xml-format))
…
```
