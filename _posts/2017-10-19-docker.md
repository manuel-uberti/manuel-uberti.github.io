Up until a few weeks ago, I had never messed with Docker. Not that I had
anything against it *per se*, but never before had I felt the need to isolate my
work in containers that can be readily built up and torn down.

Docker and its helpful companion Docker Compose come with a rich command-line
interface. Nonetheless, I don’t want to leave Emacs for simple tasks such as
building a Docker image or preparing the containers with Docker Compose.

Fortunately, the Emacs ecosystem is ready to help. Four packages have improved
my workflow with Docker:

- [dockerfile-mode](https://github.com/spotify/dockerfile-mode)
- [docker-compose-mode](https://github.com/meqif/docker-compose-mode)
- [docker-tramp](https://github.com/emacs-pe/docker-tramp.el)
- [eshell-bookmark](https://github.com/Fuco1/eshell-bookmark)

The first two packages add syntax highlighting, completion and a bunch of useful
key bindings to work with `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`.

The real magic, though, happens with `docker-tramp`. The beauty of interacting
directly with the contents of a container is impressive. Combine `docker-tramp`
with the handy completion of [counsel](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) and
the power of Dired and you might feel like Henry Dorsett Case in his ecstatic
hunt for the Neuromancer.

Through `docker-tramp` I can also run EShell on any available container and that
is where `eshell-bookmark` shines. I just have to bookmark a remote EShell
buffer and use `counsel-bookmark` to jump back to it. Managing containers hardly
gets any faster than this.

A little advice if you use both `counsel` and `eshell-bookmark`: do
not set `counsel-bookmark-avoid-dired` to `t`, otherwise selecting a bookmark
with `counsel-bookmark` will take you to `counsel-find-file` instead of opening
the desired EShell buffer.
