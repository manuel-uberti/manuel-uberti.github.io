summary:    Resolutions for my first Clojure conference.
categories: programming

As a functional programming jock, I have a confession to make: I have never been
to a Clojure conference. There was a bit of Clojure in the now defunct
LambdaCon, but the talks there were not as riveting as the ones I caught on
YouTube from the likes of Clojure/conj, clojuTRE and Clojure/west.

No need to sound depressing, though. Thanks to [7bridges](https://7bridges.eu),
I will happily attend [Dutch Clojure Days 2018](http://clojuredays.org/) on
April 21st. As much as my enthusiasm is hard to contain, I plan to fulfil a
bunch of resolutions without losing myself in total exuberance.

### Learn something new
I know the list of speakers is not ready yet, but surely something new and good
is waiting for me. This is usually what happens with the talks once the
conference I missed makes the videos available, therefore I am pretty confident
there is going to be a lot of food for my brain.

### Learn something better
As far as my Clojure projects go, there is still plenty I have to
master. Transducers? Spec? Design patterns? Performance? UX? Hit me, please. The
amateur in me is eager to become a Clojure programmer worth his salt.

### Join the community
Last but not least, I will set aside my never-ending fight with sociability and
enjoy the Clojure community for real. I’ll be in Amsterdam from Friday afternoon
to Sunday evening, so you will have enough time to join me in some healthy
discussions about your favourite programming language. Or Emacs, if you fancy
wild topics.
