Years of Emacs, and I am still learning something new that improves my daily
workflow.

Recently I’ve had to deal with CSV files, generated by a little Clojure program
using data from different databases. The CSV files are then imported in another
database through a new shiny application bought by our customer. Data
integration, exactly.

While the data extraction is just a matter of SQL queries, the CSV files must
match the stringent requirements of the new application. We ended up with messy
CSV files, close but not _that_ close to the expected results. Needless to say,
sometimes we have to edit the files manually, and this is where Emacs once again
shines.

The problem is simple: how can I list only the matches I am looking for in a CSV
file, without printing the whole lines the matches belong to? I need a clean
list of occurrences, nothing more, because debugging these files is already
painful as it is.

I am so used to [swiper-isearch](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) and
[counsel-rg](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) that I tend to forget Emacs
built-in [occur](https://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/occur.html). As per the
documentation:

> When NLINES is a string or when the function is called interactively with
> prefix argument without a number (\`C-u\' alone as prefix) the matching
> strings are collected into the \*Occur\* buffer by using NLINES as a
> replacement regexp.

Hence, I just need to:

- press <kbd>C-u M-s o</kbd> (or the equivalent but longish of <kbd>C-u M-x
occur</kbd>)
- type the string I am looking for
- hit <kbd>RET</kbd>

It doesn’t get easier than this.
