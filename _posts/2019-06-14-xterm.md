I’ve been using `shell-mode` regularly [for almost two years
now](https://manuel-uberti.github.io/emacs/2017/10/07/m-x-shell/). It has helped
me a lot in staying focused on what I’ve been doing in Emacs instead of
switching back and forth between the buffer and GNOME Terminal.

A recent discovery made `shell-mode` even snappier and more pleasant to use:
[xterm-color](https://github.com/atomontage/xterm-color).

By simply following the guidelines in the README you get a working setup for
`shell-mode`. Note that there are also examples for EShell and compilation
buffers, so it’s up to you to decide where you want to use `xterm-color`.

Honestly I complied. I only changed the default colours to match those of [my
favourite theme](https://github.com/purcell/color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow):

``` emacs-lisp
(defvar mu--tomorrow-night-colours ["#1d1f21" "#cc6666"
                                    "#b5bd68" "#f0c674"
                                    "#81a2be" "#b294bb"
                                    "#8abeb7" "#c5c8c6"])
(setq xterm-color-names mu--tomorrow-night-colours
      xterm-color-names-bright mu--tomorrow-night-colours)
```

By the way, the `ls` alias mentioned
[here](https://manuel-uberti.github.io/emacs/2017/10/07/m-x-shell/) is not
needed any more.
