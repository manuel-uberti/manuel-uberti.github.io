Quick announcement.

I’m going to be in Leuven from 1 to 3 August, ready to enjoy [Heart of
Clojure](https://heartofclojure.eu/).

I’ve been following the development of the conference since the first
announcements, and the awesome team behind it has been keeping me really excited
along the way. The incredible variety of topics in the
[program](https://heartofclojure.eu/program) is already enough to skyrocket my
expectations.

As I did with [Dutch Clojure
Days](https://manuel-uberti.github.io/programming/2018/04/23/dcd-round-up/) last
year, I’ll take notes diligently and report my experience here as soon as I get
back.

If you fancy wise Clojure chats or wild Emacs ramblings, get in touch. There is
a dedicated `#heartofclojure` channel on
[Clojurians](https://clojurians.slack.com/) which I’ve already joined, or you
can always rely on good old [emails](https://manuel-uberti.github.io/contact/).

See you there, Clojurists!
