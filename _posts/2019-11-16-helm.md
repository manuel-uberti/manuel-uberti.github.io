It was a cold winter back in December 2014. If memory serves me well, it was
time spent at tinkering with old hardware and obscure window managers, reading
my first books on functional programming, and dealing with something about text
editors I can’t quite put my finger on.

I was also reading about [Helm](https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/) and the
praises everywhere in the Emacs community for this package: it can do this, it
improves that, it will take you closer to Emacs Nirvana. So yeah, I believed the
hype, because it came from trusted sources, especially the Nirvana-guy. Soon
Helm took over my configuration and I was using it for everything: switching
buffers, selecting bookmarks, in-buffer and per-project searches. Anything
involving candidates completion was in the wise hands of Helm.

After a while [Ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) came along, and the rest
is history. I have been using Ivy/Counsel for such a long a time I might as well
say they have become the central drivers of my Emacs setup. Along with the likes
of [counsel-projectile](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper), these are the
packages I use the most during the day.

Lately I’ve been following some conversations about
[completion-styles](http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Var/completion-styles.html),
and when I learned that [Thierry Volpiatto](https://github.com/thierryvolpiatto)
was working on leveraging Helm for this I just could not resist. Note that
Thierry is still devising the implementation, so there is no need to rush at
opening issues and scream at him. Anyway, Helm was back in my radar now, and so
I took the chance to see if I could come up with a setup which would mirror my
everyday workflow with Ivy/Counsel.

I immediately noticed that the theme I use lacked proper support for some Helm
faces, but nothing stopped me to [do something about
it](https://github.com/purcell/color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow/pull/144). Much
like Ivy/Counsel, Helm provides its own version for common operations such as
`helm-M-x`, `helm-find-files`, `helm-mini`, `helm-recentf`, `helm-bookmarks`,
`helm-show-kill-ring`, and `helm-resume`. These are the core features for me,
and they work as expected. I also enabled `helm-adaptive-mode` and
`helm-autoresize-mode`, fixing the Helm window height to my preferences.

As I did with Ivy/Counsel, I made buffer switching (i.e., `helm-mini`) ignore
some files:

``` emacs-lisp
(require 'helm-buffers)
(setq helm-ff-skip-boring-files t)
(dolist (regexp '("\\`\\*direnv" "\\`\\*straight" "\\`\\*xref"))
  (cl-pushnew regexp helm-boring-buffer-regexp-list))
```

My projects are all Git-versioned, hence I installed
[helm-ls-git](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm-ls-git), which superseded
Projectile and the related `helm-projectile` in an instant. In order to make
per-project lookups with Helm as easy as they were with Ivy/Counsel, I went with
[helm-ag](https://github.com/syohex/emacs-helm-ag) and
[helm-xref](https://github.com/brotzeit/helm-xref). To make it even better,
I added [psession](https://github.com/thierryvolpiatto/psession) and configured
it to persist the things I need from my Emacs sessions. The only goodies I put
on top of this setup are [helm-bibtex](https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex)
and [helm-tramp](https://github.com/masasam/emacs-helm-tramp).

Back in the day, Helm felt heavier and more bloated than Ivy/Counsel, but that
is nonsense and was probably due to me being still young and inexperienced at
Emacs tweaking. In fact, it still takes less than one second for my Emacs to
boot, and so far there is nothing in terms of functionalities I have been
missing from my previous configuration. We could argue about UI minimalism and
design choices as long as we want, or we could simply try what the Emacs
ecosystem offers and decide for ourselves what suits our text editor best.
