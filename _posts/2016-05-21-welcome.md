summary:    Why am I writing in English, now!?

This is my new personal website.

I used to have a personal website in Italian where I wrote regularly about my
experiments with GNU/Linux and GNU Emacs.

I decided to stop writing in Italian for different reasons:

- my English is good enough to give it a try
- I am already writing in English for my
  [film blog](https://filmsinwords.wordpress.com/), so it makes sense to stick
  with English
- I am going to have way more chances to discuss my thoughts with the world

In this blog you will find short and long writings about GNU Emacs, a bit of
Clojure and LaTeX and occasional bits on GNU/Linux.
