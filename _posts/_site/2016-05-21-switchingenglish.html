<p>This is my new personal website.</p>

<p>I used to have a personal website in Italian where I wrote regularly about my
experiments with GNU/Linux and GNU Emacs.</p>

<p>I decided to stop writing in Italian for different reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>my English is good enough to give it a try</li>
  <li>I am already writing in English for my
<a href="https://filmsinwords.wordpress.com/">film blog</a>, so it makes sense to stick
with English</li>
  <li>I am going to have way more chances to discuss my thoughts with the world</li>
</ul>

<p>Beside the language, there is another difference between the two blogs. Instead
of an article every Monday like I did on my previous website, I will write
whenever I feel like writing.</p>

<p>It’s a <em>personal</em> blog, isn’t it?</p>
