<p>There is no need for me to tell you how great
<a href="http://www.flycheck.org/">Flycheck</a> is. If you do not trust me, at least trust
<a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/spotlight-flycheck-a-flymake-replacement">Mickey Petersen</a>
on this.</p>

<p>Since IÂ have been playing around with <a href="http://call-cc.org/">CHICKEN Scheme</a> for
quite some time now, it seemed only natural to wish for on-the-fly syntax
checking. Why limit myself to wishing, though? Why do not push it a little
further and try to help Flycheck maintainers?</p>
