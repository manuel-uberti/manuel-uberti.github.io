If you have any questions at all about me and my experience, or if you like to
talk all things Emacs, just drop me an email. IÂ tend to prefer encrypted emails,
so you can use my [GPG
key](https://github.com/manuel-uberti/manuel-uberti.github.io/blob/master/pubkey.txt)
when writing to me.

- Key ID: `CAA48F62`
