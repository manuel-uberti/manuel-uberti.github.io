My name is Manuel Uberti.

I have been using GNU/Linux and free and open source software for years. I am
comfortable with various distributions, desktop environments and window
managers. However, [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) and
[GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) are my daily companions.

I use [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with a
[personal configuration](https://github.com/manuel-uberti/.emacs.d) for
programming (Emacs Lisp, Clojure), writing (LaTeX, Markdown) and organising my
work (Org-mode).

Java developer by day, I have been developing Java EE applications more or less
since 2004, both in Italy and in the United Kingdom.

I share most of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/manuel-uberti).

Aside from computing and GNU Emacs in particular, my other passion is
cinema. I have another blog for that:
[Film in Words](https://filmsinwords.wordpress.com/).
