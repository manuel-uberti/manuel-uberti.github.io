As the name of the website aptly suggests, my name is Manuel Uberti.

I am a happy GNU/Linux user, comfortable with but not interested in other
operative systems. I use [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with
a [personal configuration](https://github.com/manuel-uberti/.emacs.d) for most
of my activities.

Software developer at [7Bridges](https://7bridges.eu/), I have been developing
Java enterprise applications more or less since 2004, both in Italy and in the
United Kingdom. Lately my interest has shifted towards functional programming
thanks to languages such as Clojure and Scala. If you really want me to pick a
language I tend to avoid the winner would be PHP.

Some of my work is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/manuel-uberti).

Aside from computing, I love cinema and sometimes write about it on my other
blog: [Films in Words](https://filmsinwords.wordpress.com/). Avid reader and
music listener, I consider a cup of tea the supreme relief.
