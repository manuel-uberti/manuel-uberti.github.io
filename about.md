### Me

Hi, my name is Manuel Uberti.

Clojure and ClojureScript developer at [7bridges](https://7bridges.eu/),
I started my career in 2004 developing Java enterprise applications. I worked
both in Italy and in the United Kingdom for a wide range of customers: petrol
companies, hospitals, job centres, insurance companies, banks, fashion stores.

Since 2015 my interest has shifted towards functional programming thanks to
languages such as Scheme and Clojure. Some of my work is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/manuel-uberti).

Aside from computing, I love cinema and sometimes write about it on my other
blog [Films in Words](https://filmsinwords.wordpress.com/) and on
[Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/muberti/). Avid reader and music listener,
I consider a cup of tea to be the supreme relief.
