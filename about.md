### Me

My name is Manuel Uberti.

I started my career in 2004 developing Java enterprise applications. I have
worked both in Italy and in the United Kingdom on software deployed to a wide
range of customers: petrol companies, hospitals, job centres, insurance
companies, banks, fashion stores, colour and additive factories.

In 2015 my interest has shifted towards functional programming thanks to
languages such as Scheme and Clojure. Since
[2017](https://manuel-uberti.github.io/programming/2017/03/12/anewjob/) my daily
job involves Clojure and ClojureScript at [7bridges](https://7bridges.eu/). My
open source work is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/manuel-uberti).

I am also a cinephile, but I have [another blog](https://www.filmsinwords.eu)
for that.

[Get in touch](https://manuel-uberti.github.io/contact/) if you want a
detailed curriculum vitae.

### Website

version of [Pixyll](http://pixyll.com/). The source code of the entire website
