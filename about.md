My name is Manuel Uberti.

I have been using GNU/Linux and free and open source software for years. I use
GNU Emacs to work with LaTeX and study programming languages of the Lisp family
(Emacs Lisp, Clojure, Scheme and Common Lisp).

Java developer by day, I have been developing web applications in Java more or
less since 2004, both in Italy and in the United Kingdom.

You can find my open source work on [GitHub](https://github.com/manuel-uberti).

Aside from computing and GNU Emacs in particular, my other passion is
cinema. I have another blog for that:
[Film in Words](https://filmsinwords.wordpress.com/).
