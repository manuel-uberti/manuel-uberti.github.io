My name is Manuel Uberti.

I have been using GNU/Linux and free and open source software for
years. [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) and [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) are
my daily companions and I use [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
with a [personal configuration](https://github.com/manuel-uberti/.emacs.d) for
most of my activities.

Software developer at [Vegan Solutions](http://vegans.it/), I have been
developing Java enterprise applications more or less since 2004, both in Italy
and in the United Kingdom. In the last couple of years, my interest has shifted
towards functional programming thanks to languages such as Clojure and Scala.

Some of my work is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/manuel-uberti).

Aside from programming and GNU Emacs in particular, I love cinema and write
about it on my other
blog: [Films in Words](https://filmsinwords.wordpress.com/).
