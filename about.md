### Me

Hi, my name is Manuel Uberti.

I started my career in 2004 developing Java enterprise applications. I have
worked both in Italy and in the United Kingdom on software deployed to a wide
range of customers: petrol companies, hospitals, job centres, insurance
companies, banks, fashion stores, colours and additives factories.

Since 2015 my interest has shifted towards functional programming thanks to
languages such as Scheme and Clojure. At the moment my daily job involves
Clojure and ClojureScript, and I am studying Haskell in my spare time.

My open source work is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/manuel-uberti). These are some of the projects
I created or contributed to:

- [boodle](https://manuel-uberti.github.io/programming/2017/11/26/boodle/):
  a single page application in Clojure and ClojureScript for in-house accounting
- [remys](https://github.com/7bridges-eu/remys): a Clojure tool that provides
  REST APIs to interact with MySQL databases
- [clj-odbp](https://github.com/7bridges-eu/clj-odbp): a Clojure driver for
  [OrientDB](http://orientdb.com/orientdb/) binary protocol
- [stitchcounter-js](https://github.com/manuel-uberti/stitchcounter-js):
  a little JavaScript tool to help you with knitting and crocheting

As a passionate programmer, I follow the tenets described in the
[Programmer’s Oath](https://github.com/Widdershin/programmers-oath).
