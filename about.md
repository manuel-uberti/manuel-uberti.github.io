My name is Manuel Uberti.

I have been using GNU/Linux and free and open source software for
years. [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) and [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) are
my daily companions and I use [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
with a [personal configuration](https://github.com/manuel-uberti/.emacs.d) for
most of my activities.

Software developer at [Vegan Solutions](http://vegans.it/), I have been
developing Java enterprise applications more or less since 2004, both in Italy
and in the United Kingdom. Lately my interest has shifted towards functional
programming thanks to languages such as Clojure and Scala.

Some of my work is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/manuel-uberti).

Aside from computing, I love cinema and sometimes write about it on my other
blog: [Films in Words](https://filmsinwords.wordpress.com/). Avid reader and
music listener, I consider a cup of tea the supreme relief.
