My name is Manuel Uberti.

I started my career developing Java enterprise applications. I have worked both
in Italy and in the United Kingdom on software deployed to a wide range of
customers: petrol companies, hospitals, job centres, insurance companies, banks,
fashion stores, colour and additive factories.

In 2015 my interest has shifted towards functional programming thanks to
languages such as Scheme and Clojure. Since [2017](https://www.manueluberti.eu/programming/2017/03/12/anewjob/) my daily job involves Clojure
and ClojureScript at [7bridges](https://7bridges.eu/). My open source work is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/manuel-uberti).

I am also a cinephile, but I have [another blog](https://www.filmsinwords.eu) for that. [Get in touch](https://www.manueluberti.eu/contact/) if you
want to know more, or if you are looking for a detailed curriculum vitae.

This website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a modified version of [Pixyll](http://pixyll.com/). The source
code of the entire website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/manuel-uberti/manuel-uberti.github.io).
