Hi, my name is Manuel Uberti.

Clojure and ClojureScript developer at [7bridges](https://7bridges.eu/),
I started my career in 2004 developing Java enterprise applications. I worked
both in Italy and in the United Kingdom for a wide range of customers: petrol
companies, hospitals, job centres, insurance companies, banks, fashion stores.

Since 2015 my interest has shifted towards functional programming thanks to
languages such as Clojure and Scala. Some of my work is available
on [GitHub](https://github.com/manuel-uberti).

I am a happy GNU/Linux user. I am comfortable with other operative systems, but
it’s been years since the last time something different ran on my
machines. I use [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with
a [personal configuration](https://github.com/manuel-uberti/.emacs.d) for most
of my activities.

Aside from computing, I love cinema and sometimes write about it on my other
blog [Films in Words](https://filmsinwords.wordpress.com/) and
on [Mastodon](https://functional.cafe/@manuel_uberti). Avid reader and music
listener, I consider a cup of tea to be the supreme relief.
