Hi, my name is Manuel Uberti.

Clojure/ClojureScript developer at [7bridges](https://7bridges.eu/), I have been
developing Java enterprise applications more or less since 2004, both in Italy
and in the United Kingdom.

Since 2015 my interest has shifted towards functional programming thanks to
languages such as Clojure and Scala. If you asked me to pick a language I tend
to avoid the winner would be PHP. If you asked me to pick what language I would
like to study next the winner would be Rust.

Some of my work is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/manuel-uberti).

I am a happy GNU/Linux user, comfortable with but not interested in other
operative systems. I also use [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
with a [personal configuration](https://github.com/manuel-uberti/.emacs.d) for
most of my activities.

Aside from computing, I love cinema and sometimes write about it on my other
blog: [Films in Words](https://filmsinwords.wordpress.com/). Avid reader and
music listener, I consider a cup of tea to be the supreme relief.
