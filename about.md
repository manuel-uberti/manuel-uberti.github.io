### Me

Hi, my name is Manuel Uberti.

I started my career in 2004 developing Java enterprise applications. I have
worked both in Italy and in the United Kingdom for a wide range of customers:
petrol companies, hospitals, job centres, insurance companies, banks, fashion
stores.

Since 2015 my interest has shifted towards functional programming thanks to
languages such as Scheme and Clojure.

My open source work is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/manuel-uberti). These are some of the projects
I made or I contributed to:

- [boodle](https://manuel-uberti.github.io/programming/2017/11/26/boodle/):
  a single page application in Clojure and ClojureScript for in-house accounting
- [remys](https://github.com/7bridges-eu/remys): a Clojure tool that provides
  REST APIs to interact with MySQL databases
- [clj-odbp](https://github.com/7bridges-eu/clj-odbp): a Clojure driver for
  [OrientDB](http://orientdb.com/orientdb/) binary protocol
- [stitchcounter-js](https://github.com/manuel-uberti/stitchcounter-js):
  a little JavaScript tool to help you with knitting and crocheting

Aside from computing, I love cinema and write about it on my other blog [Films
in Words](https://filmsinwords.wordpress.com/) and on
[Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/muberti/). I track the books I read on
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74813419-manuel-uberti) and I am
an avid music listener. A cup of tea is the supreme relief, and I cannot be
convinced otherwise.
