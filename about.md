My name is Manuel Uberti.

I have been using GNU/Linux and free and open source software for
years. [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) and [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) are
my daily companions and I use [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
with a [personal configuration](https://github.com/manuel-uberti/.emacs.d) for
most of my activities.

Java developer by day, I have been developing Java EE applications more or less
since 2004, both in Italy and in the United Kingdom. Lately I have been focusing
more on Lisp-friendly languages such as Clojure and Scheme.

Some of my work is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/manuel-uberti).

Aside from computing and GNU Emacs in particular, my other passion is
cinema. I have another blog for that:
[Film in Words](https://filmsinwords.wordpress.com/).
